                        <p class="italic-text">When it comes to Angels most of us typically fall into two camps: we are either total non beleivers or we associate them with religion.

                        <h2>What is Angel Therapy?</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify w-text">Angel therapy is a non-denominational spiritual healing method that involves working with your guardian angels and archangel. A particularly attuned person can connect with angels through their own work. Others need a practitioner who will use an angel card deck to give readings and who can channel your angels.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Why do it?</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify w-text">Everyone has guardian angels and connecting with them helps create more peace in your life. Angels can give clear guidance in many areas finances,relationships, health and tapping into your life's purpose. They are practical helpers who intervene in our everyday lives but we have to ask for their help because angels dont and wont impose on anyones freewill.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What Will It Feel Like?</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify w-text">Connecting with angels feel like meeting family or reuniting with best friends you haven't seen in ages,there's a sense of familiarity, love and recognition that's healing all on its own. Come prepare with questions or intentions and you will be guided to the angel cards that are most appropriate for you at the moment. Expect a co-creative experience in which you and the angels come together.
