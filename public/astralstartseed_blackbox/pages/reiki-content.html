                        <h2>What is Reiki?</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify w-text">
                            Reiki was rediscovered in the mid 1800 by a Japanese born Buddhist Monk,  Dr. Mikao Usui. While teaching in a collage , Dr Usui was asked by a student how Jesus facilitated the healing miracles that he performed. The question had planted a seed and set Dr Usui out on a path to answer that question. He was determined to learn the secret healing so that he may help others and his journey took him to many countries. During his journey Dr Usui travelled to the Holy mountains of Kori Yama where he fasted and meditated for 21 days in order to attain a high altered state of conciousness which he beleived would empower him with the healing energy. The energy not only enlightened him but also brought with it Reiki- Ryoho,which is the ability to heal.

                        <p class="text-justify w-text">Reiki works on different levels: the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual  enhancing overall being of an individual. One of the greatest Reiki healing health benefits are stress reduction and relaxation which triggers the body's natural healing abilities, aids in better sleep and improves and maintains health. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify w-text"> Reiki is a Japanese technique that is used to heal physical and mental trauma and to support mental clarity and spritual well being. In Japanese the word "rei" refers to a higher intelligence that permeates all being and non living entities and guides the inherent functioning of the universe. The word "ki" refers to the non physical energy that flows through everything that is alive  including plants, animals and human beings because of this Ki is also known as "qi" or "chi" from other lineages. The combination of these two words is what defines Reiki as "spiritually guided life force energy".
